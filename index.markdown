### Average Daily Routine
- ***Breakfast:*** ~7:30/8:00am. See details in *Food* section below.
- ***Walk 1:*** Immediately after breakfast. He will poop and pee during the walk. This can be a small walk around the community. Jack usually pees every 4 hours if left to hang out and/or on walks. He usually poops twice per day - once after breakfast walk and once after dinner/before bed. ***Find poop bags in the cabinet in the entryway on the first floor***
- ***Mid-Day Activity:*** At LEAST one good walk and/or fetch during the day maybe noon/after-noon, whenever and wherever is most convenient for you. See *Activities* section below for more details and ideas. He might also poop during the walk.
- ***Dinner:*** ~7:30/8:00pm. See details in *Food* section below.
- ***Walk 2:*** Immediately after dinner. A short walk will suffice. Just for him to pee and poop.
- ***Sleep:*** Just before your bed time feel free to walk him outside again just around the corner of the house to pee. He wont disturb you at all during night time. Jack normally sleeps on our bed every night. Depending on his comfort level, he will most likely want to sleep at your feet if you are comfortable with this. Otherwise, he will make himself comfortable on the couch or his bed in the living room.

### Food

- **What:** [Hill's Science Diet - Adult Perfect Weight Dog Food](https://www.hillspet.com/dog-food/sd-canine-adult-perfect-weight-dry){:target="_blank"} (available at [Pet Smart](https://goo.gl/maps/8De7SyFPr7EQbDW57){:target="_blank"})
- **When:** Twice per day. Breakfast is ~7:30/8:00am and dinner is ~7:30/8:00pm
- **How much:** One heaping scoop from the big container at each meal.
- **Water:** Please keep his water bowl full at all times. He's usually good about drinking water, but if it seems like he hasn't been drinking enough, point to the bowl, bring him close, and say “WATER” and he’ll drink it if he wants. You can get a pitcher from the fridges' beverage center to fill his bowl up.
- ***Optional:*** Up to once per day, Jack may have a treat if you feel inclined. Find the treats in the pantry on your left *(they're actually dog vitamins)*.
- **Other details:** If you notice Jack staring at his food and/or looking at you after you fill his bowl, he may be waiting for permission - just say “OKAY” or "GO" and he’ll start eating. If you want him to wait for a moment to dive into his food, firmly say "WAIT" before giving him permission to begin eating.

### Activities
1. Walks - Anywhere and everywhere (except the beach), as often as you want.
2. Fetch - Jack *LOVES* to run after a ball
3. Toys - Find these in the second floor patio or the white drawers in the garage next to the metal shelving. Tennis balls are his favorite!
4. Hikes - If you're feeling ambitious, Jack is a wonderful hiking partner. He can hike pretty much any terrain and loves to scamper up rocky trails
##### Favorite Places (walking distance)
- Walking paths - There are many walking paths in the community. One path starts right outside the front door and to the right. You can also cross the small pedestrian bridge across the creek bed and turn left or right for another walking path.
- [Laguna Dog Park](https://goo.gl/maps/TZ61pAB6EGRvnUUv6){:target="_blank"} - Small park that's a short walk from our house. He likes to sniff around and just do his thing. You can also play fetch here.

### Behavior
Jack is generally very well behaved and calm. He does well with dogs, cats, and people (including kids). He is polite and gentle, and usually does not initiate interactions with other animals. He entertains himself easily when you are engaged with other things. We have a patio on the second floor, which should allow you to open the door for him to come and go as he pleases. He will play with toys and such. He does not bark regularly, just in specific instances as described below.
##### Mild Triggers:
- Heel Nipping (Cattle dog instinct): Sometimes when things move too fast or if he is startled he will nip your heels or the heels of passersby. It doesn't hurt as he is just trying to herd. Just say "Stop it" and he will stop. He will also sometimes nip door edges when opening and closing them. Please keep the baby gate on the first floor stair closed and him contained inside when you leave him alone in the house.
- Uncommon noises late at night (protective instinct): Might cause Jack to growl & bark; can be startling but resolves quickly with reassurance and pets. Pretty standard for any dog we assume.
- Driving (excited): He whines in the car to let you know he's excited to go wherever you're going. If you roll down his window he likes to stick his nose out to feel the breeze.
- The beach (excited): Jack's favorite place is the beach, so he gets very hyper when he sees it. If you're driving somewhere with the ocean in view, be prepared to hear him whine continuously. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING HIM TO THE BEACH as this is the only place he can be hard to handle
- Laser pointers, bright reflections, and shadows (sillyness): Jack is *obsessed* with unexpected movement of light. He will chase them and remain hyper focused on them indefinitely until his attention is redirected. This can be entertaining!

2. STAY
3. DOWN - If sitting already, he will lie down
4. TAG - Hold out your hand and he will boop your palm; can be used to get him to jump if you hold your hand up high

6. CIRCLE - Say “Circle” and rotate your hand in a circular motion and he will spin in a circle.
7. SNOOT - Cup your hands in a circle and say "SNOOT" and he will place his nose in your hands
8. LEGS - Standup with your legs apart, say "LEGS" with your hand behind the tunnel and he will run through your legs
9. PLACE - Call his name, point to wherever you want him to go (ex. on top of a bench), and say "PLACE".
10. PAW - Will give you his paw for a shake.
11. OTHER PAW - will give you is other paw.
