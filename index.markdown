### Routine
- ***Breakfast:*** ~8:00am. See details in *Food* section below.
- ***Potty:*** Open back door at the same time as breakfast. He'll go out to do his business and come back when he's finished. Jack usually pees every few hours if left to hang out and/or on walks. He usually poops twice per day - once after breakfast (or on walk) and once after dinner/before bed. ***Find poop bags in basket on kitchen counter or in cabinet above washing machine***
- ***Exercise:*** At LEAST one good walk and/or fetch per day, whenever and wherever is most convenient for you. See *Activities* section below for more details and ideas.
- ***Dinner:*** ~8:00pm. See details in *Food* section below.
- ***Sleep:*** Open back door for him to potty or take him to the area in front of our house for a few minutes. Jack normally sleeps on our bed every night. Depending on his comfort level, he will most likely want to sleep at your feet if you are comfortable with this. Otherwise, he will make himself comfortable on the couch or his blanket in the living room.

### Food

- **What:** [Hill's Science Diet - Adult Perfect Weight Dog Food](https://www.hillspet.com/dog-food/sd-canine-adult-perfect-weight-dry){:target="_blank"} (available at [Pet Smart](https://goo.gl/maps/LWWQ6EY3t4nzLP6a6){:target="_blank"})
- **When:** Twice per day. Breakfast is ~8:00am and dinner is ~8:00pm 
- **How much:** One heaping scoop from the big container at each meal. Add a splash of milk or tablespoon of yogurt on top from the fridge.
- **Water:** Please keep his water bowl full at all times. He's usually good about drinking water, but if it seems like he hasn't been drinking enough, point to the bowl, bring him close, and say “WATER” and he’ll drink it if he wants.
- ***Optional:*** Up to once per day, Jack may have a treat if you feel inclined. Find the treats in the orange or red containers near the toaster oven *(they're actually dog vitamins)*.
- **Other details:** If you notice Jack staring at his food and/or looking at you after you fill his bowl, he may be waiting for permission - just say “OKAY” or "GO" and he’ll start eating. If you want him to wait for a moment to dive into his food, firmly say "WAIT" before giving him permission to begin eating.

### Activities
1. Walks - Anywhere and everywhere (except maybe the beach), as often as possible/desired
2. Fetch - Jack *LOVES* to run after a ball 
3. Toys - Find these on his blanket in the living room, outside the back door, or in the cabinet above the washing machine. Tennis balls are his favorite!
4. Hikes - If you're feeling ambitious, Jack is a wonderful hiking partner. He can hike pretty much any terrain and loves to scamper up rocky trails
##### Favorite Places (walking distance)
- Neighborhood walk - It's a nice area for walks. Lots of streets to turn down, wander, and enjoy the sunshine
- [Eastside Neighborhood Park](https://goo.gl/maps/sXikBjdhoLcN1dn37){:target="_blank"} - Small park a short walk from our house. Great for a quick game of fetch!
##### Favorite Places (short drive)
- [Dwight Murphy Field](https://goo.gl/maps/VuDxWeriH6bcTD2x5){:target="_blank"} - Best place for fetch!
- [Douglas Preserve](https://goo.gl/maps/Qb1TuJ392iVigESDA){:target="_blank"} - FAVORITE place overall, and it will probably be your favorite too! Absolutely stunning views from cliffside above the beach. Very dog friendly and hands down best place for a scenic walk in Santa Barbara. [Click here](https://goo.gl/maps/FH9QgFjzExm9sDHj9){:target="_blank"} for directions to free street parking in a neighborhood next to the trail access. Easy flat walk, but your feet will get dusty.
- [Santa Barbara Mission](https://goo.gl/maps/pRgCMQrdoCrKyCVK8){:target="_blank"} - Beautiful garden and grassy field; good for picnics, walks, and fetch.
##### Hikes
- [Parma Park](https://goo.gl/maps/BJqcUXajbNih5AYS8){:target="_blank"} - Parking on street close to trail head.
- [Lizard's Mouth](https://goo.gl/maps/HjU1ZPKLE7uXtDkA9){:target="_blank"} - Parking on street close to trail head or a little further ahead.

### Behavior
Jack is generally very well behaved and calm. He does well with dogs, cats, and people (including kids). He is polite and gentle, and usually does not initiate interactions with other animals. He entertains himself easily when you are engaged with other things. We have a fenced side yard, which should allow you to open the back door (off the laundry area) for him to come and go as he pleases. Feel free to leave the back door open with him out in the yard while you work inside, and he will play with leaves and such. He does not bark regularly, just in specific instances as described below.
##### Mild Triggers:
- Heel Nipping (Cattle dog instinct): Sometimes when things move too fast or if he is startled he will nip your heels or the heels of passersby. It doesn't hurt as he is just trying to herd. Just say "Stop it" and he will stop (begrudgingly)
- Street noise or neighbors coming home late at night (protective instinct): Might cause Jack to bark; can be startling but resolves quickly with reassurance and pets
- Driving (excited): He whines in the car to let you know he's excited to go wherever you're going. If you roll down his window he likes to stick his nose out to feel the breeze.
- The beach (excited): Jack's favorite place is the beach, so he gets very hyper when he sees it. If you're driving somewhere with the ocean in view, be prepared to hear him whine continuously. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING HIM TO THE BEACH as this is the only place he can be hard to handle
- Laser pointers, bright reflections, and shadows (sillyness): Jack is *obsessed* with unexpected movement of light. He will chase them and remain hyper focused on them indefinitely until his attention is redirected. This can be entertaining!

### Tricks
1. SIT
2. STAY
3. DOWN - If sitting already, he will lie down
4. TAG - Hold out your hand and he will boop your palm; can be used to get him to jump if you hold your hand up high
5. Leave it - Show him a treat and say “LEAVE IT” and drop it a few feet from him. He won’t eat it till you say "OK" or "GO"
6. CIRCLE - Say “Circle” and rotate your hand in a circular motion and he will spin in a circle. 
7. SNOOT - Cup your hands in a circle and say "SNOOT" and he will place his nose in your hands 
8. LEGS - Standup with your legs apart, say "LEGS" with your hand behind the tunnel and he will run through your legs
9. PLACE - Call his name, point to wherever you want him to go (ex. on top of a bench), and say "PLACE".
